Detecting a cycle in a linked list is a common problem in computer science and data structures.
It can be solved using a popular algorithm called Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm.
The idea behind this algorithm is to use two pointers, one slow (tortoise) and one fast (hare), that traverse the linked list at different speeds. 
If there's a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, detecting the cycle.

Here's the basic concept:

1. Initialize two pointers, one called `slow` and another called `fast`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

2. Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time, and the `fast` pointer two steps at a time.

3. If there is no cycle in the linked list, the `fast` pointer will eventually reach the end of the list (i.e., `fast` becomes `NULL`), and you can conclude that there is no cycle.

4. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. When this happens, you have detected a cycle.

Here's a simple representation of this algorithm in C:

```c
bool hasCycle(struct ListNode* head) {
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        return false; // No cycle with less than 2 nodes
    }

    struct ListNode* slow = head;
    struct ListNode* fast = head;

    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        slow = slow->next;       // Move slow pointer one step
        fast = fast->next->next; // Move fast pointer two steps

        if (slow == fast) {
            return true; // Cycle detected
        }
    }

    return false; // No cycle detected
}
```

In this code:

- We first check if the list is empty or has only one node because a cycle requires at least two nodes.

- We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially pointing to the head of the list.

- In the `while` loop, we advance the `slow` pointer by one step and the `fast` pointer by two steps.

- If there is a cycle, the pointers will eventually meet (slow == fast), and we return `true`.

- If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (fast == NULL or fast->next == NULL), we conclude that there is no cycle, and we return `false`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, making it an efficient way to detect cycles in a linked list.
